# AgroAdvisor-ML-Causal
A two-stage ML and causal inference system for smart crop selection and yield optimization. Uses Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost for crop recommendation, followed by T-Learner to suggest fertilizer adjustments (N, P, K, pH) for improved productivity. Ideal for precision agriculture.
This repository contains code and data for a two-stage decision-support framework:
1. **Crop Recommendation** using ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost)
2. **Yield Optimization** via Causal Inference (T-Learner)

## 🔍 Features
- Crop selection based on soil and climate
- Causal yield recommendations for N, P, K, and pH
- End-to-end interpretability
- Visualizations and sample dashboards
